## How it works
When publishing an article, Bliszter will save the article to Redis after publish is successful.

### How the data is stored:

Bliszter stores all articles to Redis. It uses RedisJSON to store data in a unified format to be used by all three blogging platforms.
```
const articleSchema = new Schema(Article, {
  userId: { type: "string" },
  title: { type: "string" },
  markdown: { type: "string" },
  medium_url: { type: "string" },
  hashnode_url: { type: "string" },
  devto_url: { type: "string" },
});

```

### How the data is accessed:

Data from Redis is accessed by RedisSearch which filters all articles for a particular user.

## How to run it locally?
